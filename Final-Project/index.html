                        <p>Raccoons are not native to Germany, but in less than 100 years, the number of the little masked mammals in the country has grown to several hundred thousand. Some Germans refer to them as waschb√§ren ‚Äî washing bears ‚Äî because of their habit of dunking their food before they eat it, while other Germans just call them straight-up annoyances. Especially when beer is involved.
                            <br> <br>
                            Vacationers and locals alike are getting home and discovering that raccoons have raided their kitchens, causing thousands of dollars worth of damage in the process, including killing household pets and stealing any beer they can find. On less frustrating occasions, the raccoons have been seen at city parks, knocking over discarded beer bottles so they could drink whatever booze was left inside. ‚ÄúRaccoons are funny and clever ‚Ä¶ and they like beer,‚Äù Berthold Langenhorst of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU), said.
